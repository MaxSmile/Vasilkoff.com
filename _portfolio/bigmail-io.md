- **Data Management with MongoDB & MySQL**: To handle data efficiently, MongoDB and MySQL were employed, offering a flexible and reliable database solution.
- **Client-Side Dynamics with jQuery & Bootstrap**: jQuery and Bootstrap contribute to the project's dynamic and responsive design, ensuring compatibility across different devices and browsers.
- **Design Precision with Figma, HTML5, and CSS3**: The use of Figma for UI/UX design, coupled with HTML5 and CSS3 for front-end development, results in a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate platform.
