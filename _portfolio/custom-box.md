Vasilkoff Ltd had the opportunity to collaborate with a Manhattan-based company, BandC IND., to develop Custom Box, a tailored iOS application designed to streamline their custom-sized box pricing process. This project reflects our commitment to creating practical mobile app solutions that address specific business challenges.

## Overview of Custom Box App
Custom Box serves as a digital tool for BandC IND.’s sales team, enabling them to obtain quick and accurate pricing for custom-sized boxes. Developed with the user in mind, the app is intuitive, simplifying the sales process and enhancing the efficiency of obtaining up-to-date pricing.

### Features and Functionality
- **Immediate Pricing**: By inputting the dimensions and specifications of boxes, salespeople can instantly receive price quotes, aiding in prompt and informed customer service.
- **Objective-C Development**: Leveraging Objective-C allowed us to build a stable and reliable app tailored to the iOS platform, ensuring a seamless experience for users.
- **Adaptability**: The app accommodates a wide range of box sizes and custom printing options, demonstrating its versatility to meet diverse customer requirements.
- **Regional Availability**: Custom Box is available for delivery in Brooklyn, New Jersey, and Manhattan, specifically designed to integrate smoothly with BandC IND.’s operational zones.

### Collaborative Approach
Our development process involved close collaboration with BandC IND. to ensure that the app met their precise needs. From initial concept through to launch, we focused on creating an app that not only streamlined the pricing process but also supported BandC IND.’s sales strategy.

Post-development, Vasilkoff Ltd provided comprehensive training to ensure that BandC IND.’s sales team could maximize the app’s potential. Additionally, we ensured that Custom Box was fully compatible with the company’s existing systems, facilitating a smooth integration into their daily operations.
