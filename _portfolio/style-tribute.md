StyleTribute Seller is a web application that we developed using node.js and express.js. It is part of StyleTribute, Asia's leading curated marketplace for pre-loved luxury fashion. The seller app allows users to easily list their luxury fashion items for sale on the platform.

Sellers can upload photos, enter item details, and set their own prices. All items are then sent to StyleTribute's head office in Singapore to undergo rigorous checks by their in-house quality control team, ensuring both authenticity and quality.

The web app provides a simple and efficient way for sellers to monetize their pre-loved luxury items while providing buyers with a trusted environment to purchase high-quality fashion pieces from coveted brands such as Hermes, Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent, Prada, and many more.`,
