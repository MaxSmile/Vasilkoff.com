Vasilkoff Ltd had the pleasure of working with Libi and Daughters, a luxury cosmetics brand known for its premium skincare products. Tasked with enhancing their digital footprint, we provided full-stack development services that spanned front-end and back-end development, as well as creating native mobile applications for both iOS and Android platforms.

## Project Overview: Libi and Daughters Digital Platform
Our objective was to develop a comprehensive digital solution that aligns with Libi and Daughters' brand values of sophistication, quality, and elegance, ensuring their clientele enjoys a seamless shopping experience.

### Development Approach
- **Front-End Development with ReactJS**: Utilizing ReactJS, we crafted a responsive and visually appealing website interface that mirrors the luxury essence of the Libi and Daughters brand.
- **Back-End Development with NodeJS**: The website’s back-end, built with NodeJS, supports robust and efficient data management, ensuring a smooth operation of online sales and customer interactions.
- **Native Mobile Applications**: To extend the brand’s reach, we developed native mobile applications for iOS and Android, enabling customers to explore and purchase products conveniently from their smartphones.

### E-Commerce Integration
The project involved integrating Shopify for e-commerce functionality, allowing for an intuitive product selection and checkout process. Additionally, Stripe was incorporated to provide secure and diverse payment options, while Firebase was used to manage real-time data syncing across the website and mobile apps.

### Impact and Outcome
The collaboration between Vasilkoff Ltd and Libi and Daughters has resulted in a robust digital platform that not only enhances the brand's online presence but also offers an unparalleled shopping experience to their global clientele.
