When it comes to cutting-edge Fintech solutions, Vasilkoff has always been at the forefront, as our latest accomplishment at the BOC Hackathon Fintech 3.0 proves. This event, hosted from October 18th to 20th at the IDEA Innovation Center in Nicosia, brought together coders and startups to develop Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) for Fintech innovation.

Dr. Demetris Antoniades, the leader of the Digitally Enhanced Urban Environments (DARE) MRG, participated as a mentor at the hackathon and shared his extensive expertise. The Bank of Cyprus facilitated the teams by offering its upgraded open banking APIs and SDK, enabling integration of innovative features such as secure payment processing or data utilization services.

In preparation for this event, two open API days were held in Limassol and Nicosia on October 9 and 10. Participants were given insights into the latest Fintech trends and the Bank of Cyprus's advanced APIs.

Vasilkoff, represented by a dedicated team of three professionals, [Maxim Vasilkov](/team/maxim-vasilkov), [Anastasia Sarlidou](/team/anastasia-sarlidou), and [Simon Papazov](/team/simon-papazov), made an impressive showing. Their ingenuity shone through when they developed the 'SmartWallet', an inventive system bridging the gap between traditional banking and electronic contracts.

SmartWallet provides a fast, cost-effective means for businesses and individuals to access a wide range of financial services, all while complying with the existing laws of Cyprus. This innovation was so well-received that it won the team the second prize, an award of â‚¬4,000!
