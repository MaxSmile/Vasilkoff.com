Measuring the success of outsourced mobile apps and web-development projects can be challenging, particularly when working with a third-party team. However, there are several key metrics that businesses can use to evaluate the success of these projects. Here are some key metrics for measuring the success of outsourced mobile apps and web-development projects:

## On-time delivery
On-time delivery is one of the most important metrics for measuring the success of outsourced mobile apps and web-development projects. This metric measures whether the project was delivered on schedule, according to the agreed-upon timeline.

## Budget adherence
Budget adherence measures whether the project was delivered within the agreed-upon budget. This metric is important for ensuring that the project remains financially feasible and for preventing unexpected expenses.

## Quality
Quality measures whether the project meets the established quality standards. This includes factors such as code quality, design quality, and performance. This metric is important for ensuring that the project meets the expected standards of quality.

## Customer satisfaction
Customer satisfaction measures how satisfied the end-users are with the final product. This metric is important for ensuring that the project meets the needs of the business and provides value to the end-users.

## Productivity
Productivity measures the efficiency of the development team. This includes metrics such as lines of code per hour, bug fix rates, and project completion rates. This metric is important for ensuring that the development team is working efficiently and delivering results.

## Communication and collaboration
Communication and collaboration measure how effectively the outsourced team communicates and collaborates with the business. This includes factors such as response times, feedback loops, and regular check-ins. This metric is important for ensuring that the outsourced team is aligned with the business goals and is working effectively with the internal team.

In conclusion, measuring the success of outsourced mobile apps and web-development projects requires careful consideration of several key metrics. By tracking metrics such as on-time delivery, budget adherence, quality, customer satisfaction, productivity, and communication and collaboration, businesses can evaluate the success of outsourced projects and make improvements where necessary.
