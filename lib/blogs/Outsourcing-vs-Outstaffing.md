Outsourcing and outstaffing are two popular models for accessing talent outside of your organization. Both options can provide businesses with access to specialized skills, cost savings, and flexibility. However, they differ in their approach and may be better suited to certain business needs. Here are some creative examples to help you determine which model is the best fit for your business.

## Outsourcing:
Outsourcing involves hiring a third-party company to handle a specific project or function on behalf of your business. This model can provide businesses with access to a wider range of skills and expertise that may not be available in-house.

**Example:** If your business needs a software application developed, you could outsource the project to a third-party mobile apps and web-development company. This company would take care of the entire mobile apps and web-development process from start to finish, including project management, design, development, testing, and delivery.

## Outstaffing:
Outstaffing, on the other hand, involves hiring remote developers who work exclusively for your organization but are employed by a third-party company. This model can provide businesses with access to specialized skills and flexibility in scaling their development team up or down.

**Example:** If your business has an ongoing need for mobile apps and web-development talent, you could hire a team of remote developers through an outstaffing company. These developers would work exclusively for your organization but would be employed by the outstaffing company, which would take care of administrative tasks such as payroll and benefits.

## Which is the Best Fit for Your Business?
When deciding between outsourcing and outstaffing, there are a few key factors to consider. One of the main considerations is the scope and duration of the project. Outsourcing is typically better suited for one-time projects, while outstaffing is better suited for ongoing needs.

Another factor to consider is the level of control you want over the project or team. Outsourcing provides businesses with less control over the project, as the third-party company handles the entire development process. Outstaffing, on the other hand, provides businesses with more control over the development team and process.

In conclusion, both outsourcing and outstaffing can be beneficial for businesses looking to access specialized skills and expertise. By considering factors such as project scope and duration, level of control, and budget, businesses can determine which model is the best fit for their needs.
