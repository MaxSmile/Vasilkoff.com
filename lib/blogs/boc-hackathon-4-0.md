### BOC Hackathon Fintech 3.0: Making Headlines

In the [BOC Hackathon Fintech 3.0](https://vasilkoff.com/blog/boc-hackathon-fintech-3-0) hosted from October 18th to 20th at the IDEA Innovation Center in Nicosia, our team showcased the 'SmartWallet', an innovative system that bridges traditional banking with electronic contracts. Represented by [Maxim Vasilkov](/team/maxim-vasilkov), [Anastasia Sarlidou](/team/anastasia-sarlidou), and [Simon Papazov](/team/simon-papazov), this innovation clinched the second prize with an award of €4,000!
