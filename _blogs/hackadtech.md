## Pioneering Integration: AI and Social Media
### Vasilkoff's Hackathon Innovation
During the HackAdTech‘23 Hackathon in Limassol, Cyprus, our team at Vasilkoff made a significant breakthrough by developing AI-Bridge. This 48-hour event became a platform for us to demonstrate our innovative capabilities in connecting AI with the world of social media messaging.

### AI-Bridge: The Game Changer
Our project, [AI-Bridge](https://ai-bridge.vasilkoff.com), is designed to seamlessly integrate AI Language Models or custom GPTs with popular social media chats like Facebook Messenger and Instagram DMs. This tool acts as the crucial missing gear, enabling efficient and intelligent communication between businesses and their clients.

### Practical Demonstration
For our presentation, we successfully connected our CEO, Maxim's Instagram DMs (@max_vasilkoff) to a Custom GPT, allowing it to answer queries about Vasilkoff Ltd. This not only showcased AI-Bridge's practical utility but also its potential to revolutionize how companies interact with their audience.

### The Accolade
Our innovative approach was recognized with the second prize at HackAdTech‘23 - an Apple Watch Series 9. This accolade is a testament to our team's relentless pursuit of technological excellence and innovation.

### The Impact
AI-Bridge paves the way for businesses to integrate advanced AI capabilities into their customer interactions, elevating the user experience and efficiency. This tool is a step forward in our ongoing efforts to harness the power of AI for practical, user-friendly applications.

### What's Next for Vasilkoff
This achievement at HackAdTech‘23 is just the beginning. We are excited to further develop and refine AI-Bridge, along with our other projects, to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in AI and blockchain technology.
