**Recognition Through Collaboration and Competition**

While modesty remains a core value, it's important to acknowledge the recognition the Vasilkoff team has earned through participation in prestigious technology hackathons. Our quiet dedication to innovation was highlighted when we secured 2nd place at the Fintech Hackathon 3.0 ([read more](https://vasilkoff.com/blog/boc-hackathon-fintech-3-0)) with a blockchain project, demonstrating our capability to develop cutting-edge financial technology solutions. Further participation in tech competitions, such as the BOC Hackathon 4.0 ([learn about our participation](https://vasilkoff.com/blog/boc-hackathon-4-0)) with an AI project, underscores our commitment to advancing technology across sectors.

**AI-Bridge: Bridging Communication Gaps**

Our recent achievement during the HackAdTech‘23 Hackathon in Limassol, Cyprus, where we developed AI-Bridge and earned 2nd prize ([discover more](https://vasilkoff.com/blog/hackadtech)), exemplifies our innovative approach to solving real-world challenges. AI-Bridge stands as a game changer in digital communication, seamlessly integrating AI Language Models or custom GPTs with popular social media chats like Facebook Messenger and Instagram DMs. This breakthrough tool serves as a crucial link, enhancing the way businesses interact with their clients through intelligent, efficient communication platforms.
