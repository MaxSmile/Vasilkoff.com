SendCrypto is an innovative application aimed at simplifying peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-business (P2B) crypto payments globally. With the proliferation of digital currencies, our team recognized the need for a streamlined, accessible and secure platform to facilitate international crypto transactions. Thus, SendCrypto was born.

The primary challenge in this project was to ensure security, scalability, and seamless transactions. We employed the MATIC blockchain, known for its superior scalability and energy-efficient design, to house our smart contracts. This decision was driven by our commitment to adopting advanced and environment-friendly blockchain technologies.

The smart contracts that we developed for SendCrypto are comprehensive and robust, encompassing the primary token as well as numerous staking sub-contracts. These contracts, being public on the MATIC blockchain, guarantee transparency and build user trust, setting the groundwork for a thriving and inclusive digital financial ecosystem.

Our efforts have paid off, as evidenced by the excellent category score of 79.38 and placement in the top 20th percentile. This accomplishment, while rewarding, is also a testament to the expertise and dedication we bring to every project.

Despite achieving a high score, we remain committed to continuous improvement. This commitment was tested in the most recent audit, delivered on October 24th, 2022. We conducted a comprehensive review of our smart contracts, identified areas for improvement, and have since implemented corrective measures. This constant process of audit and improvement is key to maintaining the highest level of security and functionality for our users.

SendCrypto serves as a testament to Vasilkoff Ltd.'s prowess in blockchain development and our capability to provide reliable smart contract solutions. We look forward to enabling more businesses and individuals to harness the power of blockchain technology, driving forward the digital economy.`,

We developed a comprehensive social media strategy for Heptapolis.com, which included creating and managing social media accounts on various platforms such as Telegram, Bitcointalk, Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. This helped to increase the visibility of the project and attract potential investors.

        article:`
Naviaddress is a decentralized digital addressing platform that aims to revolutionize the traditional postal addressing system. Our team was responsible for developing the mobile apps that allow users to easily create and share digital addresses called "naviaddresses".

The decentralized nature of the platform means that users can create naviaddresses that are not tied to any centralized database or authority. This allows for a more secure and transparent addressing system, where users have full control over their naviaddresses and the information associated with them.

The app is designed to be user-friendly, with visual aids and clear instructions to guide users through the process of creating and sharing naviaddresses. Users can add metadata to their naviaddresses, such as route descriptions, contact information, social media links, and photos. This makes it easier for others to find and navigate to their desired destination.

One of the key features of Naviaddress is its ability to create unique naviaddresses for virtually any location, whether it's a home, office, restaurant, or even a temporary event space. This makes it a valuable tool for businesses and individuals alike, as it simplifies the process of communicating and sharing addresses.

In summary, our team developed the mobile apps for Naviaddress, a decentralized digital addressing platform that provides a more secure, transparent, and user-friendly alternative to traditional postal addresses. With its unique features and user-friendly design, Naviaddress has the potential to become the go-to addressing system for the 21st century.`,

        article:`
The Calculator Lock app is a privacy protection application for Android devices that allows users to easily hide their photos, videos, apps and files. With an inbuilt private browser, users can safely browse private websites and download photos to instantly lock them inside the photo vault. The app also includes a shake close feature for quick app closure and an intruder selfie feature that takes a picture of anyone who tries to break into the app. Additionally, users can create a fake vault with a different password for storing fake photos and videos. The app also provides fingerprint unlock for faster and more secure access. With a colourful theme and icon disguise, the app offers a variety of fashionable colours to create an exclusive theme. Users can effectively sort and organize their encrypted private files and easily locate, rename, and delete photos, pictures, and videos in the secret gallery vault. Finally, the app includes a break-in alert feature that snaps anyone who tries to break into the user's privacy.
